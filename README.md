# 2V-Theft-Locator
Our anti-theft model for two-wheelers is a system that leverages GSM signals to track stolen vehicles. The system is designed to pinpoint the latitude and longitude coordinates of the stolen two-wheeler. It then utilizes this data to generate a real-time Google Map location link, which is transmitted directly to the owner's mobile through network.
